# Social Sentiment Tracker

Social Sentiment Tracker is a full-stack application that ingests social media posts in real time, performs sentiment analysis on each post using NLTK's VADER, and visualizes trending moods on a dynamic dashboard built with Plotly Dash.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Simulated retrieval of social media posts (easily replaceable with live API calls).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses NLTK’s VADER to classify posts as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** A Plotly Dash-based dashboard that updates every 10 seconds with current sentiment trends.
- **Modular Design:** Separation of concerns with dedicated modules for data fetching, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
- **Testing & Docker:** Comes with unit tests and a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
